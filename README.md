# CSCI-C310-Sorting-Algorithms
## For this program, you will want to ensure that all of your algorithm files (insertion sort, bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort, and radix sort) have all been imported correctly with all of the code as well as the main class.
## In order to run the proper time tests for each of these sorting algorithms, you will first want to determine which test case you would like to use. Depending on how many variables you would like to have each algorithm sort, you will chose the respective test case and enter that case into to each sorting algorithm method as a parameter within the main class (the current inputted test case is testCase5).
## Once each proper test case is inputted as a parameter for all five algorithms, you will then want to run the main python file. The terminal will output the corresponding time each algorithm takes to sort each test case, which will be displayed in seconds. From there, you should be able to use this data to compare the time efficiency of each algorithm with the outputted time.
